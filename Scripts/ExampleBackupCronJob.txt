One way to set a cronjob to take a backup of etc and var every 15 minutes would be:

1. Do crontab -e
2. */15 * * * * tar -czvf /home/backups/etc.tar.gz /etc

2. */15 * * * * tar -czvf /home/backups/var.tar.gz /var

Downsides to this are that it will replace the previous backup.
If it were made into a proper script, you would be able to increment the backups so that you can have several of them
